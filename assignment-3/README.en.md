## Description
The goal of the third assignment - implement a packet routing simulation for a chosen/given algorithm. User is allowed to place the nodes, connect them and 
mark the start and end nodes. Application then imitates the exchange of network packets, showing their route and changes on the network.
If the protocol demands it, routing tables need to be updated. 
The student needs to know the cons and pros of the chosen protocol and in what networks it is used. What problems of other protocols it solves.
